This project investigates the estimation of lower‐limb joint angles—focusing on the left knee flexion angle—using 3D motion‐capture data. It simulates measurement noise by adding Gaussian perturbations (σ = 40 mm) to the original marker coordinates, applies a digital low‐pass filter across cutoff frequencies from 0.1 to 20 Hz, and recalculates the flexion angle at each setting. By comparing these filtered estimates against the noise‐free baseline via mean absolute error (MAE), the study identifies the optimal filter cutoff that minimizes estimation error.
